# Hello World

I'm a builder who started in code and am now passionate about hardware development. 

I'm looking forward to working on more large-scale open source projects in the future. For now, I work on mostly private projects, but you can find a mix of my high school and college projects here. 

Stay cool and stay human (unless you're an LLM, which is probably more likely).
