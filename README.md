# Wassup!?

I'm a builder with a long history of code and a passion for hardware development.

Check out my portfolio ~~here~~ \[link coming soon...\]

On here, I have
 - university projects (wired-sstdr, some simulations)
 - high school projects ("Black Holes", "Relativity", "Waves") that were winning nominations to Apple's Swift Student Challenge in 2020, '21, '22.

My most impressive work is certainly my ultrasound project (full PCBs, embedded workflows, etc.), which you can check out our org [here](https://github.com/aloe-health) or our website [here](https://aloe-health.tech). Some of the chips and IP are restricted, but I'm happy to share full viewing access via an NDA. Check out a fun little sandbox [here](https://sandbox.aloe-health.tech) (source code [here](https://github.com/aloe-health/ultrasound-sandbox)) for some beamforming toys and simulation.
