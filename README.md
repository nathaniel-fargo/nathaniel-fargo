# What's going on??

I'm a builder with a history of code and a passion for hardware development.

Check out my portfolio [here](https://nathaniel-fargo.github.io/)

On here, I have
 - university projects (wired-sstdr, some simulations)
 - high school projects ("Black Holes", "Relativity", "Waves") that were winning nominations to Apple's Swift Student Challenge in 2020, '21, '22.
 - personal website and portfolio

My most impressive work is certainly my ultrasound project (extensive PCBs, embedded workflows, etc.), which you can check out our org [here](https://github.com/aloe-health) or our website [here](https://aloe-health.tech). Some of the chips and IP are restricted, but I'm happy to share full viewing access via an NDA. Check out a fun little sandbox [here](https://sandbox.aloe-health.tech) (source code [here](https://github.com/aloe-health/ultrasound-sandbox)) for some beamforming toys and simulation.
